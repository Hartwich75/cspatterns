            <p> 
                The AWP Fade is a covert skin form the Control collection, which got added to the game on the 3rd December 2020 during the operation broken fang.
                Itâ€™s a very expensive and unique skin like the other fade skins.

                <br>

                This means pattern 129 will always be the same Fade%.
                The most desired patterns and Fade% for the AWP Fade are the ones with Max Fade% or Minimum Fade%, usually Max Fade% are the most desired.
