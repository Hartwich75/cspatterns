            <h1> M4A1-S Fade Pattern Guide </h1>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h2> M4A1-S Fade </h2>
            <p> 
                The M4A1-S Fade is a covert skin form the Sports & Field Collection, which was added to the game on the 4th October 2024 in the Armory update.

                <br>
                <br>

                The M4A1-S Fade has a Fade%, which ranges from 80% - 100% and each unique pattern is connected to the same Fade%.
                This means pattern 129 will always be the same Fade%.
                The most desired patterns and Fade% for the M4A1-S Fade are the ones with Max Fade% or Minimum Fade%, usually Max Fade% are the most desired.

                <br>
                <br>

                The Fade% also has an effect on the colors of the skin itself.
                Where higher fade will make the skin more purple and less white, and lower fade will make the skin more white and less purple.

            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Float </h2>
            <p>
                The M4A1-S Fade can be obtained in the float range 0.00 - 0.08.
                This means the skin only exists in Factory New and Minimal Wear condition.
                Also, this is really rare in Minimal Wear condition since this only can be obtained in the float range 0.07 - 0.08.
            </p>
