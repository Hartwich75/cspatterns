            <h1> Lil' Whiskers Charm Pattern Guide </h1>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h2> Lil' Whiskers Charm </h2>
            <p> 
                The Lil' Whiskers Charm is a remarkable collectible from the Missing Link Charm collection, which was added to the game on the 4th October 2024.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                Like any other charm in the game, the Lil' Whiskers charm is pattern based.
                The pattern determines the look of the charm itself.
                For the Lil' Whiskers charm it changes the color of the entire charm, depending on the pattern it can be blue, purple, pink, brown, yellow, green, or turquoise.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Blue Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The low patterns on the charm will make the charm blue.
                As the pattern gets closer to 1 it will be more blue.
                This means pattern 1 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as blue as it can get.

            <p>
                The patterns around pattern 10.000 on the charm will make the charm purple.
