            <h1> Lil' Sandy Charm Pattern Guide </h1>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h2> Lil' Sandy Charm </h2>
            <p> 
                The Lil' Sandy Charm is a remarkable collectible from the Missing Link Charm collection, which was added to the game on the 4th October 2024.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                Like any other charm in the game, the Lil' Sandy charm is pattern based.
                The pattern determines the look of the charm itself.
                For the Lil' Sandy charm it changes the color of her bathing suit, depending on the pattern it can be red, orange, green, blue, purple, or pink.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Red Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The low patterns on the charm will make the bathing suit red.
                As the pattern gets closer to 1 it will be more red.
                This means pattern 1 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as red as it can get.

            <h2> Orange Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The low patterns on the charm will make the bathing suit orange.
                As the pattern gets closer to 10.000 it will be more orange.
                This means pattern 10.000 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as orange as it can get.

            <h2> Green Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The low-mid patterns on the charm will make the bathing suit green.
                As the pattern gets closer to 40.000 it will be more green.
                This means pattern 40.000 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as green as it can get.

            <h2> Blue Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The high-mid patterns on the charm will make the bathing suit blue.
                As the pattern gets closer to 70.000 it will be more blue.
                This means pattern 70.000 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as blue as it can get.

            <h2> Purple Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The high patterns on the charm will make the bathing suit purple.
                As the pattern gets closer to 90.000 it will be more purple.
                This means pattern 90.000 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as purple as it can get.
