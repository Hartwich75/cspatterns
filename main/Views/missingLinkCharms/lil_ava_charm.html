            <h2> Lil' Ava Charm </h2>
            <p> 
                The Lil' Ava Charm is a high grade collectible from the Missing Link Charm collection, which got added to the game on the 4th October 2024.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                Like any other charm in the game, the Lil' Ava charm is pattern based.
                The pattern determines the look of the charm itself.
                For the Lil' Ava charm it changes the color of the FBI vest on Ava, depending on the pattern it can be green, brown, or purple.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Green FBI Vest Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The low patterns on the charm will make Ava wear a green FBI vest.
                As the pattern gets closer to 1 it will be more green.
                This means pattern 1 is the best pattern and the pattern where the FBI vest is as green as it can get.

            <h2> Brown FBI Vest Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The mid-range patterns on the charm will make Ava wear a brown FBI vest.
                As the pattern gets closer to 40.000 it will be more brown.
                This means pattern 40.000 is the best pattern and the pattern where the FBI vest is as brown as it can get.
