            <h1> Diamond Dog Charm Pattern Guide </h1>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h2> Diamond Dog Charm </h2>
            <p> 
                The Diamond Dog Charm is a exotic collectible from the Missing Link Charm collection, which was added to the game on the 4th October 2024.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                Like any other charm in the game, the Diamond Dog charm is pattern based.
                The pattern determines the look of the charm itself.
                For the Diamond Dog charm it changes the shiny look of the charm, depending on the pattern it can be shiny or matte.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Shiny Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The low patterns on the charm will make the charm shiny.
                As the pattern gets closer to 1 it will be more shiny.
                This means pattern 1 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as shiny as it can get.

            <h2> Matte Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The high patterns on the charm will make the charm matte and have no shiny.
                As the pattern gets closer to 100.000 it will be more matte.
                This means pattern 100.000 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as matte as it can get.
