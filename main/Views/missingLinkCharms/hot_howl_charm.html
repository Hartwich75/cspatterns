            <h1> Hot Howl Charm Pattern Guide </h1>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h2> Hot Howl Charm </h2>
            <p> 
                The Hot Howl Charm is an extraordinary collectible from the Missing Link Charm collection, which was added to the game on the 4th October 2024.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                Like any other charm in the game, the Hot Wurst charm is pattern based.
                The pattern determines the look of the charm itself.
                For the Hot Howl charm it changes the color of the entire charm, depending on the pattern it can be glowing orange/red, orange/red, or matte orange/red.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Glowing Orange/Red Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The low patterns on the charm will make the charm glowing orange/red.
                As the pattern gets closer to 1 it will be more glowing.
                This means pattern 1 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as glowing orange/red as it can get.

            <h2> Orange/Red Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The mid patterns on the charm will make the charm orange/red without much glowing.
                As the pattern gets closer to 50.000 it will be more orange/red.
                This means pattern 50.000 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as orange/red as it can get.

            <h2> Matte orange/red Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The high patterns on the charm will make the charm matte orange/red.
                As the pattern gets closer to 100.000 it will be more matte.
                This means pattern 100.000 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as matte orange/red as it can get.
