            <h1> Hot Sauce Charm Pattern Guide </h1>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h2> Hot Sauce Charm </h2>
            <p> 
                The Hot Sauce Charm is a high grade collectible from the Missing Link Charm collection, which was added to the game on the 4th October 2024.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                Like any other charm in the game, the Hot Sauce charm is pattern based.
                The pattern determines the look of the charm itself.
                For the Hot Sauce charm it changes the color of the colored part of the charm, depending on the pattern it can be red, orange, or yellow.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Red Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The low patterns on the charm will make the charm red.
                As the pattern gets closer to 1 it will be more red.
                This means pattern 1 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as red as it can get.

            </p>

            <h2> Orange Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The mid-range patterns on the charm will make the charm orange.
                As the pattern gets closer to 50.000 it will be more orange.
                This means pattern 50.000 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as orange as it can get.

            </p>

            <h2> Yellow Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The high patterns on the charm will make the charm yellow.
                As the pattern gets closer to 100.000 it will be more yellow.
                This means pattern 100.000 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as yellow as it can get.
