            <h1> Pinch O' Salt Charm Pattern Guide </h1>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h2> Pinch O' Salt Charm </h2>
            <p> 
                The Pinch O' Salt Charm is a high grade collectible from the Missing Link Charm collection, which was added to the game on the 4th October 2024.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                Like any other charm in the game, the Pinch O' Salt charm is pattern based.
                The pattern determines the look of the charm itself.
                For the Pinch O' Salt charm it changes the color of the body, depending on the pattern it can be blue, purple, pink, red, yellow, green, or blue.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Dark Blue Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The low patterns on the charm will make the charm be dark blue.
                As the pattern gets closer to 1 it will be more dark blue.
                This means pattern 1 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as dark blue as it can get.

            <h2> Purple Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The low patterns in the range around 10.000 on the charm will make the charm be more purple.
