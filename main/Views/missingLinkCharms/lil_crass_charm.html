                The Lil' Crass Charm is a high grade collectible from the Missing Link Charm collection, which got added to the game on the 4th October 2024.

            <h2> Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                Like any other charm in the game, the Lil' Crass charm is pattern based.
                The pattern determines the look of the charm itself.
                For the Lil' Crass charm it changes the color of the headband on Crass, depending on the pattern it can be red, orange, yellow, green or blue.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Red Headband Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The low patterns on the charm will make Crass wear a red headband.
                As the pattern gets closer to 1 it will be more red.
                This means pattern 1 is the best pattern and the pattern where the headband is as red as it can get.
