            <h1> Lil' SAS Charm Pattern Guide </h1>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h2> Lil' SAS Charm </h2>
            <p> 
                The Lil' SAS Charm is a high grade collectible from the Missing Link Charm collection, which was added to the game on the 4th October 2024.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                Like any other charm in the game, the Lil' SAS charm is pattern based.
                The pattern determines the look of the charm itself.
                For the Lil' SAS charm it changes the color of the eyes, depending on the pattern it can be red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, or pink.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Red Eyes Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The low patterns on the charm will make the charm's eyes red.
                As the pattern gets closer to 1 it will be more red.
                This means pattern 1 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as red as it can get.
