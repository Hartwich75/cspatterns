            <h2> That's Bananas Charm </h2>
            <p> 
                The That's Bananas Charm is a remarkable collectible from the Missing Link Charm collection, which was added to the game on the 4th October 2024.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                Like any other charm in the game, the That's Bananas charm is pattern based.
                The pattern determines the look of the charm itself.
                For the That's Bananas charm it changes the color of the entire charm, depending on the pattern it can be brown, yellow, or green.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Brown Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The low patterns on the charm will make the charm brown.
                As the pattern gets closer to 1 it will be more brown.
                This means pattern 1 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as brown as it can get.

            <h2> Yellow Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The mid-range patterns on the charm will make the charm yellow.
                As the pattern gets closer to 50.000 it will be more yellow.
                This means pattern 50.000 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as yellow as it can get.

            <h2> Green Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The high patterns on the charm will make the charm green.
                As the pattern gets closer to 100.000 it will be more green.
                This means pattern 100.000 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as green as it can get.
