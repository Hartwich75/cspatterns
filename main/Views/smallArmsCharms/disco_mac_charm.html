            <h1> Disco MAC Charm Pattern Guide </h1>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h2> Disco MAC Charm </h2>
            <p> 
                The Disco MAC Charm is a remarkable collectible from the Small Arms Charm collection, which was added to the game on the 4th October 2024.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                Like any other charm in the game, the Disco MAC charm is pattern based.
                The pattern determines the look of the charm itself.
                For the Disco MAC charm it changes the color of the charm, depending on the pattern it can be purple, pink, yellow, green and blue.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Purple Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The low patterns on the charm will make the charm purple.
                As the pattern gets closer to 1 it will be more purple.
                This means pattern 1 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as purple as it can get.

            <h2> Pink Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The patterns around pattern 20.000 on the charm will make the charm pink.
                As the pattern gets closer to 20.000 it will be more pink.
                This means pattern 20.000 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as pink as it can get.

            <h2> Yellow Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The mid patterns on the charm will make the charm yellow.
                As the pattern gets closer to 50.000 it will be more yellow.
                This means pattern 50.000 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as yellow as it can get.

            <h2> Green Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The patterns around pattern 70.000 on the charm will make the charm green.
                As the pattern gets closer to 70.000 it will be more green.
                This means pattern 70.000 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as green as it can get.
