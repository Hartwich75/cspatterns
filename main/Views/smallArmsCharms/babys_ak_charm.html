            <h1> Baby's AK Charm Pattern Guide </h1>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h2> Baby's AK Charm </h2>
            <p> 
                The Baby's AK Charm is a high grade collectible from the Small Arms Charm collection, which was added to the game on the 4th October 2024.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                Like any other charm in the game, the Baby's AK charm is pattern based.
                The pattern determines the look of the charm itself.
                For the Baby's AK charm it changes the color of the charm, depending on the pattern it can be dark brown, brown and light brown.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Dark Brown Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The low patterns on the charm will make the charm dark brown.
                As the pattern gets closer to 1 it will be darker.
                This means pattern 1 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as dark brown as it can get.

            <h2> Brown Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The mid patterns on the charm will make the charm brown.
                As the pattern gets closer to 50.000 it will be more brown.
                This means pattern 50.000 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as brown as it can get.

            </p>

            <h2> Light Brown Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The high patterns on the charm will make the charm light brown.
                As the pattern gets closer to 100.000 it will be lighter.
                This means pattern 100.000 is the best pattern and the pattern where the charm is as light brown as it can get.
