            <h2> Pocket AWP Charm </h2>
            <p> 
                The Pocket AWP Charm is a high grade collectible from the Small Arms Charm collection, which was added to the game on the 4th October 2024.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                Like any other charm in the game, the Pocket AWP charm is pattern based.
                The pattern determines the look of the charm itself.
                For the Pocket AWP charm it changes the color of the charm, depending on the pattern it can be green, blue, purple, red and brown.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Green Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The low patterns on the charm will make the gun green.
                As the pattern gets closer to 1 it will be more green.
                This means pattern 1 is the best pattern and the pattern where the gun is as green as it can get.

            <h2> Blue Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The patterns around pattern 40.000 on the charm will make the gun blue.
                As the pattern gets closer to 40.000 it will be more blue.
                This means pattern 40.000 is the best pattern and the pattern where the gun is as blue as it can get.

            <p>
                The patterns around pattern 60.000 on the charm will make the gun purple.
                As the pattern gets closer to 60.000 it will be more purple.
