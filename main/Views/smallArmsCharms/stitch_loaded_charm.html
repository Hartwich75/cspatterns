            <h1> Stitch-Loaded Charm Pattern Guide </h1>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h2> Stitch-Loaded Charm </h2>
            <p> 
                The Stitch-Loaded Charm is a high grade collectible from the Small Arms Charm collection, which was added to the game on the 4th October 2024.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                Like any other charm in the game, the Stitch-Loaded charm is pattern based.
                The pattern determines the look of the charm itself.
                For the Stitch-Loaded charm it changes the color of the charm, depending on the pattern it can be cyan, blue, purple, pink, orange, yellow and green.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Cyan Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The low patterns on the charm will make the gun cyan.
                As the pattern gets closer to 1 it will be more cyan.
                This means pattern 1 is the best pattern and the pattern where the gun is as cyan as it can get.

            <h2> Blue Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                The patterns around pattern 10.000 on the charm will make the gun blue.
                As the pattern gets closer to 10.000 it will be more blue.
                This means pattern 10.000 is the best pattern and the pattern where the gun is as blue as it can get.
