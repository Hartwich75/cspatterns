        <p> The P2000 Amber Fade is a restricted skin form the Dust 2 collection, which got added to the game on the 27th November 2013.
            The P2000 Amber Fade has a Fade%, which ranges from 80% - 100% and each unique pattern is connected to the same Fade%. This means pattern 129 will always be the same Fade%. The most desired patterns and Fade% for the R8 Revolver Amber Fade are the ones with Max Fade% or Minimum Fade%, usually Max Fade% are the most desired.
            The Fade% also has an effect on the colors of the skin itself. Where higher fade will make the skin more orange and less green, and lower fade will make the skin more green and less orange.
